            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>For this assignment, we observed real users interacting with a 
                public interface. We interviewed these individuals about their 
                experiences, designed personas based on these users, and 
                created a storyboard for one of the personas.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Interface</h2>
            <p id="interface-description">
                For my public interface, I chose the display control panel found
                in most CIT classrooms. This panel is usually mounted to the wall
                and controls the projector and TV monitors that a user can connect their computer to in the room. It's
                often used by professors for presenting slides during class and by
                students for personal use outside of class.
            </p>

            <p id="interface-description">
                The default homepage for the display control panel is the basic mode page.
                On this page, users can select the primary display mode. There is also an advanced mode
                page for specific display settings.
            </p>

                <div class="setting-modes">

                <p id="interface-description">
                    Clicking on different icons on the advanced mode page allows users to adjust parts of the display separately.
                    On the display controls page, users can turn the projector on, lower the projector screen, and turn the monitors on.
                    On the audio/visual routing display page, users can select the display source and destination.
                </p>

                    Together, all of these components make up the display control panel. A user must visit each page and tap
                    the right settings to successfully connect their computer to the projector screen.

            <h2>Observations</h2>
            <p>I observed 3 users using the display control panel to 
                connect their computers to the projector screen. The main takeaways were:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li id="obs">All users selected the right cable for their computer and plugged it in as the first step.</li>
                    <li id="obs">On the basic mode homepage, all users selected the laptop option.</li>
                    <li id="obs">Not all users immediately clicked on the advanced settings
                    option, which was the correct next step. There was noticeably 
                    a few seconds of hesitation among all users before they clicked on the advanced settings icon located at the top right of the screen.</li>
                    <li id="obs">Once users got to the advanced settings page, 2 users clicked on the display controls icon first, 
                        while 1 user clicked on the auto/video routing icon first. All users managed to choose the other option 
                        after they were done adjusting the settings on their initial screen.</li>
                    <li id="obs">On the display control screen, all users had no trouble turning the projector on and 
                        setting the projector screen to the down position. Some users also turned the monitor on, 
                        which was not necessary (the monitor on button refers to the TV monitor, not the projector in any way).</li>
                    <li id="obs">On the audio/visual routing page, users followed the two step instructions on the screen, 
                        working from top to bottom. For the select your source step, users correctly tapped the 
                        laptop option. For the assign your destination step, users showed slight hesitation. 
                        Users read through the different options for a few seconds, then tapped the projector 
                        option. They kept tapping it until it toggled to the laptop option. Some users also 
                        set the monitor option to laptop, which was not necessary. 
                    </li>
                    <li>All users used the back button on the display control and audio/visual 
                        screens to return to the advanced settings homepage, rather than clicking 
                        on the advanced settings icon again.
                    </li>
                </ul> 
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Questions</h2>
            <p>After observing the users, I asked them 5 questions each about their experience.</p>
            <ol>
                <div class="question">
                <li id="question"> What is your first impression of the basic mode home screen?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most users felt that the home screen was simple and easy to use.</li> 
                        <li>Users said that since there were only 3 main options, each with an icon and a clear labels, selecting the laptop option was a clear first step.</li>
                        <li>Some users noted that the UI was similar to the UI for Apple devices.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                <li id="question">What do you like about the interface?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All users liked how there were icons for each of the buttons and expressed that the icons were helpful for helping them select the right button. </li> 
                        <li>Users liked that the buttons turned blue or green to indicate that it was pressed.</li>
                        <li>Users responded positively to the clean and simple look of the UI.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                <li id="question">What do you dislike about the interface?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some users claimed that the advanced settings button was too small and tucked away, so it was not immediately obvious that a 
                            user has to click on the advanced settings button to progress.</li> 
                        <li>Some users pointed out the empty space surrounding the three main icons on the basic mode homepage and said that the icons could be 
                            bigger to fill the empty space.</li>
                        <li>One user disliked the distinction between basic mode and advanced mode and said that it was misleading because a user must use
                            both setting modes to connect their computer.</li>
                    </ul>  
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                <li id="question">Is there anything that you would change regarding the interface?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users would add an instruction on the basic settings homepage to direct others towards the advanced settings mode.</li>
                        <li>Otherwise, users suggested merging the basic and advanced settings homepages, since a user would need to visit both anyway.</li> 
                        <li>Users would make the main three icons on the basic settings homepage bigger to fill the empty space.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                 
                <div class="question">
                <li id="question">How did the process of connecting your computer to the display differ from your expectations.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some users said that they didn't expect the UI for the display control panel to be similar 
                            to the UI for Apple products. It was more familiar and modern than they expected.</li> 
                        <li>Some users said that the process was easier than they initially thought and admitted that
                            they since they had connected once, they can easily do it again in the future.</li>
                        <li>Users who explored the display panel further said that they did not expect there to be so many 
                            other settings that could be changed from the panel, such as adjusting the window shades
                            and starting a Zoom room.</li>
                    </ul>

                        to connect his computer to the projector so he can present his slides for the class. The professor is not too familiar
                        with the process of connecting his computer to an externel display since he did not have to do it at his old job, and 
                        he is not too familiar with the modern UI found on things such as Apple devices. This given persona represents the new
